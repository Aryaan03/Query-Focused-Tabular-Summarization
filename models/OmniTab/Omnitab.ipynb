In the first game, they play two games, which is very high, and in the second game, it is very low.

In the years of 1989, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2009, and 2017, the film's gross earn increased significantly. In contrast, the year of 2016, 2017, and 2018 saw the film make less than $1 million.\n",

      "Expected Summary: There could be several factors affecting the variation in gross earnings, including changes in audience preferences, marketing strategies, distribution channels, production budgets, and the overall socio-economic context of the time. These factors can have a significant impact on the commercial success of films and often explain the changes in gross earnings over time.   It's important to analyze the context of each film and the various factors contributing to their success or failure, rather than only looking at the release year. As a result, the key to understanding the commercial success of Bangladeshi films might not be heavily correlated to their release year, but rather a combination of multiple factors influencing the industry.\n",
